# Snake-Game


This is a simple and straight forward snake game made in c++ with aims to improve my skills in OOP, algorights, programming architechture, and so on. 


## Rules of the game: 

    - Don’t hit a wall and don’t bite your own tail.
    - Crashing into a wall or your tail will end the game immediately.
    - 10 points will be added to the player's score for eating the fruit (#).
    - The player's total score is calculated based on the number of fruits the snake consumed.
    - The length of the snake will be increased after eating the fruits.
    - Use w, a, s, d to move the snake.


  For now, only a C++ version will be made, but I might expand it into python in the near future as well.
